## Instructions

If you want to start from the starter code.
Download the zip folder or Fork the repository from the link above to your own local machine.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
